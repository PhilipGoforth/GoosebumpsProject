You, Patty, and Brad jog down a wide avenue. Tents of every color line the street. Carnival music blares from loudspeakers.
You spot a green neon sign flashing above a yellow-striped tent. The sign reads: madame zeno — fortune-teller.
“Excellent!” you exclaim. “I’m going in!”
You tell your friends you’ll catch up with them in a minute.
You lift the tent flap. Inside, one small candle flickers in the dark. You hear a low voice call out, “Enter my chamber.”
There is Madame Zeno, sitting in the shadows. She wears a long red dress dotted with brightly colored gems. They shimmer in the candlelight. Her black hair tumbles to her shoulders as she bends over a large crystal ball.
“Welcome,” she whispers. Then she reaches out and gently lifts your hand. “Let me tell you your future.”");

            WriteLine(@"Madame Zeno studies your hand closely. She traces the lines in your hand with her soft fingers.
“I see horror in your future. In your immediate future,” she warns.
“Wh-what kind of horror?” you stammer. “What do you mean?”
Madame Zeno releases your hand. She picks up a strange deck of cards. She spreads them out on the table. You notice the cards have pictures — a headless man, a bloody sword, a large, evil eye.
She gathers up all the cards and flips the deck over. Then she deals out a red card and a blue card.
“Turn one over,” she commands. “Learn your fate.”");
