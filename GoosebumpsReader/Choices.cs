An alligator.
With its mouth gaping open — revealing two rows of razor-sharp teeth.
You freeze.

“Nice alligator,” you purr as you stroke his scaly head.
Your arm trembles, but you don’t stop. And slowly — very slowly — the creature’s mouth begins to shut.
Then he rolls over and falls asleep!

Two red-haired dwarfs in clown costumes scurry up the steps. To your surprise, they fit you with new high-top sneakers — sneakers with metal studs running up the backs.
This is going to be some kind of race, you think. But then you change your mind — when they snap a heavy, metal helmet on your head.

Your eyes dart frantically from side to side. Faces suddenly appear in the darkness in bright flashes of light. 
Faces of hideous monsters with deformed heads and oozing flesh.
